## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-03

This is a significant rework, that brings most of the features previously on the roadmap, but also introduces major breaking changes. To avoid disruption, the v1 code has been moved to `legacy` sub-package and the legacy `ASTNode` is now called `AwareASTNode`. Legacy package will emit deprecation warnings on import though.

### ‚ú® Highlights
* Ability to re-use nodes across multiple ASTs without creating duplicates
* Nodes are now hashable!
* 100x faster pattern matching with support for pattern variables & simplified grammar
* ~50% faster traversal
* XPath search APIs (not unlike those in ElementTree)
* Opt-in runtime type checking of AST nodes
* ... and more

### üöÄ Added

- `pyoak.tree.Tree` class that provides API for to retrieve node parents in a tree as well as traversing "up" the tree
- `pyoak.config` module that provides global configuration options
- Opt-in runtime type checking at node creation via `pyoak.config.RUNTIME_TYPE_CHECK` flag
- XPath
    - `ASTXpath.findall` and sister `ASTNode.findall`, `ASTNode.find` methods. Work similarly to ElementTree's `findall` and `find` methods. The latter accept both a compiled `ASTXpath` instnace or string.
- Pattern Matching
    - Ability to match against multiple types: `(Type1|Type2|... ...)`
    - Pattern variables: `(* @field_val_from -> val @field_compare_to = $val)`

### ‚ú® Changed

- Traversal methods `dfs`, `bfs` and `gather` do not return the node itself anymore
- `ASTVisitor` and `ASTTransformVisitor` are now in a separate module `pyoak.visitor`
- Auto-generated ID hash size is now configurable via `config.ID_DIGEST_SIZE`, and defaults to 8 bytes (16 hex chars)
- Optional trace logging switch is now in `config` module
- `ASTNode._iter_child_fields` propoted to a public API `ASTNode.iter_child_fields`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking

- Traversal methods `dfs`, `bfs` and `gather` return a tuple of `(node, parent, field, index)` instead of just the node
- All methods of `ASTNode` that worked by going "up" the tree are now in `Tree` class
- Filters & pruners for traversal methods now must accept a tuple of `(node, parent, field, index)` instead of just the node
- Mixed fields (i.e. with types like `str | ASTNode`) are not allowed anymore. Separate properties and children into separate fields instead.
- Pattern Match grammar has been simplified:
    - any field rule is denoted just by `@field_name=...` instead of `@[child_field=...] #[property=...]` syntax.
    - there are no more `!` and `!!` flags, since sequence matching is now always "strict" (i.e. `@field_name=[]` matches only if the field is a sequence and elements match the pattern exactly)

### üêõ Fixed

- CI/CD pipeline now correctly runs tests on all platforms
- Local docformatter now uses the same parameters as the one in CI/CD pipeline

### üî• Removed

- Runtime checks during traversal/retrieving children. All the decisions whether a field is a child field and/or is a sequence are made based type annotations at class creation
- Removed the ability to provide custom `id` to `ASTNode` constructor. If you need to track source/natural ID's, use a dedicated field for that.
- `id_collision_with` and `original_id` auto-properties. Now if you need to track collisions, this must be done manually.
- `parent`, `parent_field` and `parent_index` auto-properties. Nodes are not aware of the parent anymore. Use `Tree` API instead.
- `ensure_unique_id` and `create_detached` removed as they are no longer needed
- `replace` method. Use the type-checked (as of mypy 1.5+) `dataclasses.replace` instead.
- `replace_with` method, since node's are not parent aware anymore. Use `ASTTransformVisitor` instead.
- `xpath` property and `calcualte_xpath` method. Use `Tree` instead.
- `detached`, `is_attached_root` and `is_attached_subtree` properties. No longer relevant.

### üìñ Documentation

- Updated README

### üõ†Ô∏è Internal

- Prepare to support slotted classes (contingent on Mashumaro update)

## [1.1.1] - 2023-08-02

Quick hotfix release to restore backwards compatibility with 1.0.0

### üêõ Fixed

- 1.1.0 wouldn't deserialize NoSource/NoPosition/NoOrigin serialized by an earlier version of the library. This is now fixed and the lib should be fully backwards compatible.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-08-02

### üöÄ Added

- Instantiated singleton constants NO_ORIGIN, NO_SOURCE, NO_POSITION in `pyoak.origin`

### ‚ú® Changed

- Removes unnecessary need to pass deserialization option to distinguish whether Sources were serialized as normal or as registry id's
- Serializes NoXXX classes as empty dicts now

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking

- NoSource singleton instance is not part of the Source registry anymore and reports source_registry_id as -1. However it is still returned via `Source.list_registered_sources()` API for backwards compatibility.

### üõ†Ô∏è Internal

- ‚¨áÔ∏è relaxed library dependencies

## [1.0.0] - 2023-07-29

### Added

- First public release.
