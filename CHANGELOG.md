## [1.1.0] - 2023-08-02

### 🚀 Added

- Instantiated singleton constants NO_ORIGIN, NO_SOURCE, NO_POSITION in `pyoak.origin`

### ✨ Changed

- Removes unnecessary need to pass deserialization option to distinguish whether Sources were serialized as normal or as registry id's
- Serializes NoXXX classes as empty dicts now

### ⚠️ Breaking

- NoSource singleton instance is not part of the Source registry anymore and reports source_registry_id as -1. However it is still returned via `Source.list_registered_sources()` API for backwards compatibility.

### 🛠️ Internal

- ⬇️ relaxed library dependencies
